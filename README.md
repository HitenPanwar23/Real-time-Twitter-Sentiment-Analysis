Analyzing sentiments for tweets is very helpful in determining people's opinion as positive, negative or neutral. This project evaluates the people's sentiment about a person, trend, product or brand. <br/>Twitter API is used to access the tweets directly from twitter and build a sentiment classification for the tweets.
