Sentiment analysis refers to the application for processing natural language, text analysis, computational linguistics, and biometrics to methodically recognize, extract, quantify, and learn affective states and subjective information.<br/>Twitter, being one among several popular social media platforms, is a place where people often choose to express their emotions and sentiments about a brand, a product or a service. Analyzing sentiments for tweets is very helpful in determining people's opinion as positive, negative or neutral. This project evaluates the people's sentiment about a person, trend, product or brand. <br/>Twitter API is used to access the tweets directly from twitter and build a sentiment classification for the tweets. The outcome of the analysis is depicted for positive, negative and neutral remarks about their opinions using visualization techniques such as histogram and Pie chart.<br/><br/>
In this project, we use twitter data for Narendra Modi and Rahul Gandhi. Since COVID-19 pandemic is going we analyze how people of india feel about these two personalities.
